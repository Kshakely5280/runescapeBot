![Github license](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-Other-blue.svg)
#### Description
As a child it was always my dream to automate the increasingly annoying skills in the old school runescape game. for fun, and to fulfill a childhood dream, ii am making my first bot for personal use. this is extreemly basic and generic code  that is likely easily detectable. my intention is to adjust the code to click at randomized intervals and locations in the hopes this bot may run without short term detection.
